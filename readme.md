# felix angell - truelayer coding challenge
Hi, this is my takehome test for TrueLayer. I attempted to try this in Rust to see how it would go!
I'm still new to Rust so apologies if you see any non-idiomatic Rust stuff. Regardless of the outcome
I'd love to hear any feedback/code reviews on my approach :)

This is dockerized so you can spin it up locally as so:

```shell
$ 
```

And then hit a request using Paw/Postman:

```

```

## notes
```
// the input/endpoint thing
http://localhost:5000/pokemon/charizard

// output response body
{
	"name": "charizard",
	"description": "this is the description of the charizard pokemon but shakespeare"
}
```

### todo stuff:

1. automated tests
2. structure project as if its a production thing
3. apis: pokeapi.co - funtranslations.com/api/shakespeare

readme:

1. how to run the thing
2. what im not happy with if i had more time
3. add a dockerfile
4. git history
